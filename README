This project contains code to be reviewed!

We had an consultant working for us a while back who wrote a MapReduce
framework for us. He claims that it works when he runs it on his
computer, but we have doubts about the code quality. Could you help us
point out issues in the code, where the quality standard does not meet
the requirements of a production system?
